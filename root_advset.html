                    These are the steps for a basic advanced set up
                </p>
 	<!--ALL the information for the page-->
                <p>

                    Step 1: Choose Map and Deck. Choose the map and shared deck in any way.<br/>
		    Step 2: Seat Players.Determine the seating order and the first player at random.(This player will set up last and play first.)<br/>
		    Step 3: Draw Cards. Each player draws 5 cards.<br/>
		    Step 4: Set Up Hirelings (Optional). Deal out 3 hireling cards at random and return the rest to the box. Collect the pieces for the dealt hirelings. Return all the faction setup cards to the box that correspond to the drawn hirelings (shown by color and symbol).<br/>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1. Demote. If playing with 3 players, flip 1 hireling at random to its Demoted side (marked with a D). If playing with 4 players, flip 2 hirelings at random. If playing with 5 or more, flip all 3 hirelings.<br/>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2. Set Up Hirelings. The last player in turn order performs any setup for the hirelings as described on their cards.<br/>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-3. Place Hireling Markers. Place one hireling marker each on the 4, 8, and 12 victory point spaces of the Victory Points track on the map.<br/>
		    Step 5: Deal Setup Cards.Shuffle all of the red-named faction setup cards and deal out one to a pool in the center of the table. Shuffle the remaining red-named faction setup cards together with all of the white-named faction setup cards, and deal out one per player. (In total, there will be one more faction setup card than the number of players.)<br/>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1. Two Players. If you’re only playing with two players, remove all of the white-named faction setup cards. (If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, you can include them if you’re using the hirelings.)<br/>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -2. Lock Last White Card.If the last faction setup card dealt has a white name, turn it sideways to show that it is locked. It cannot be chosen unless at least one red faction has been chosen.<br/>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-3. Vagabond. Whenever a Vagabond setup card is dealtout, also deal out one Vagabond character card at random next to it face up. If a player chooses this Vagabond in the draft, they must use this character card.<br/>
		    Step 6: Draft Factions. Starting with the last player and going counterclockwise, each player chooses one faction setup card from the pool and sets up the faction immediately (before another player chooses)as described on its setup card.<br/>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	-1. Homelands.When setting up, players might choose one or more homelandclearings. Players cannot choose homeland clearings that enemies chose as their homelands. (Sometimes, a player must choose homelands that are not adjacent to enemy homelands if able. If they cannot, they still cannot choose homelands that are in enemy homelands.)<br/>
		    Step 7: Draft Hands.Each player chooses 3 cards to keep in their hand and puts the other 2 cards facedown on the shared deck. When finished, shuffle the shared deck<br/><br/>
