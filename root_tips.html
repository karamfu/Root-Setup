                <h3>Basic Tips & Tricks To Help You Overcome The Woodlands</h3>
                <!-- Tip 1 -->
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>1. Take Advantage of Communication:</h4>
                    <p>
                        In Root, all players have the freedom of saying anything. What this means is that you have to use your voice to convince and sway your opponents to take actions that are more in your favor. Strike deals or point out threats on the board.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Tip 2 -->
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>2. Crafting:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Oftentimes, cards are used as fuels for a faction's engine, with no regards to the description of the card, rather only the suits. However, crafting these cards are far more important than you might be giving them credit for, some with extremely powerful effects that can be game changing, and it's less committal than you might believe, since almost all factions are very flexible with their crafting actions.
                    </p>
                </div>
               <!-- Tip 3 -->
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>3. Asymmetry:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every faction plays differently. Very differently. Militant factions in general are more focused on map control and securing as much turf and soldiers as possible, where insurgent factions are less focused on the board control and have a tyipcally unorthodox style of scoring points. Regardless, the point is that every faction is different, with an infinite amount of strategies strapped to each one. Really get to learn and master a faction, where you would be able to stand out no matter what matchup.
                    </p>
                </div>
		<!-- Tip 4 -->
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>4. Card Draw:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Find oppotunities to draw cards as frequent as possible. The more cards in hand will generate more versatility and more overall power for what you are able to do in your turn. Also, to other players a bigger hand is more intimidating and facilitates a smoother game for you, as players will be more hesitant to fight a large hand due to cards like Ambush.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5. Faction Specific</h4>
                    <p>
Every faction will have different counters and tips/tricks to play as or against. Check <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2138017/root-strategy-guide" target="_blank">here</a> for a well-composed list of these tips.
